## Exercise 2

### Contrast ratio for texts

Improved contrast for all the website text including the navbar
so that it complies with the WCAG-Standard

Unsolved issue: For the select options such as visible on the
registration page, the WCAG-Standard is not reached. But since
this is dependent on the webbrowser and type of device the website
is accessed by, it's hard to change.

### Page Regions

Identified Page Regions (ARIA roles) for index.html:
- banner
- navigation
- main
- article
